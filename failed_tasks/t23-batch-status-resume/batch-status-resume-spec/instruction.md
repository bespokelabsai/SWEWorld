You are an engineer at this company, working on `curator` — the Python library for bulk LLM inference and dataset curation that the company ships. You have an ordinary engineer's access and nothing more: no sudo, and no way to put code on a running service except through CI.

## The ticket

**Batch job status persistence across process restarts**

Ensure that if a Python process running a `batch=True` job is killed and restarted while a batch job is still pending on the provider's side, re-running the same script resumes polling the existing batch job instead of submitting a duplicate one.

## Requirements settled earlier

These were agreed before the ticket was written. They are not obvious from the code, so they are repeated here in full:

1.
   - *rule*: The batch job ID must be persisted to the on-disk cache directory (keyed the same way as the existing prompt cache) immediately after successful submission, before polling begins, so a crash during polling doesn't lose the ability to resume.
   - *scope*: Batch job ID persistence, submission-time only.
   - *failure behavior*: If persistence itself fails (disk full, permissions), the batch submission must still be allowed to proceed — losing resumability is preferable to blocking the job outright, but a warning must be logged.

2.
   - *rule*: On restart, before resuming an existing batch job ID, the code must verify the persisted job's provider, model name, and request payload hash still match the current run's configuration; a mismatch must cause a fresh submission rather than resuming a stale/incompatible job.
   - *scope*: Resume-time validation.
   - *failure behavior*: Mismatch causes a fresh submission with a logged reason for why the old job was not resumed, not a silent resume of incompatible results.

## Getting around

- The repository is in Gitea at <http://git.world.local/worldadmin/curator.git>. Your account is `worldadmin`, password `worldadmin`; a token is readable at `/etc/sweworld/gitea-token` if you prefer.
- Nothing is checked out for you. Clone it.
- `curator` and its dependencies are installed in the virtualenv at `$CURATOR_VENV` (`/opt/curator-dev/venv`), so `$CURATOR_VENV/bin/python` and `$CURATOR_VENV/bin/pytest` will run the library and its tests. The library itself is NOT installed there — put your checkout's `src/` on `PYTHONPATH`.
- Complete this ticket to the best of your ability using every source of information you can reach: the repository's own history and issues, the company chat, the wiki, internal mail. Any of them may carry something the ticket does not say.
- Chat is at <http://chat.world.local>, the wiki at <http://docs.world.local>, webmail at <http://mail.world.local>, and the service list at <http://pass.world.local>. Gitea and Mattermost want the username `worldadmin`; BookStack and Roundcube want the email `worldadmin@world.local`.
- The wiki has a REST API — `Authorization: Token $(cat /etc/sweworld/bookstack-token)` — and `/api/search?query=...`, `/api/pages/{id}` return JSON, which is easier to read than the HTML.
- `wait-for-service <name>` blocks until a service answers.

## Done means

The change is merged to `main` in Gitea, CI is green for that commit, and the running release has picked it up — pushing is what deploys here, and it takes about half a minute.
